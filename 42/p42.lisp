;The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn =
;Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

;1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

;By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
;alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word
;value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 =
;t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the
;word a triangle word.

;Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text
;file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are
;triangle words?
