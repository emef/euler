;Euler published the remarkable quadratic formula:

;n² + n + 41

;It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the
;consecutive values n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40, 402 + 40 + 41 =
;40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41² +
;41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.

;Using computers, the incredible formula n² 79n + 1601 was discovered,
;which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The
;product of the coefficients, 79 and 1601, is 126479.

;Considering quadratics of the form:

;n² + an + b, where |a|  1000 and |b|  1000

;Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic
;expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive
;values of n, starting with n = 0.
